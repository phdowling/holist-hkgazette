holist-hkgazette

Holist is a platform for document analysis. This repository is an example of how it can be deployed to explore a document set, in this case the Hong Kong Gazette. There are no advanced analysis features in this example, only a data source that wraps the raw data, and an interface for ElasticSearch to make the data searchable.
